# Pocket Guide

This project serves as a simple book database, where an user can insert new books anytime, being loaded at startup with some books.

# Running

### Gradle

To run this program directly from Gradle, you can use the command `./gradlew bootRun`. Your project will load some books at startup on a memory database, so every time the system is turned off, we lose the previously registered items.
